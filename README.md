# 🧠 Data Structures in Python  

Welcome to the **Data Structures** repository by [**Faizan Ashiq**](https://github.com/Faizan-Ashiq)!  
In this section, we’ll explore Python’s most powerful built-in data structures — **Lists**, **Tuples**, **Sets**, and **Dictionaries** — with detailed explanations, real-world examples, and practice problems designed for both beginners and intermediate learners.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Lists
- Definition and creation of lists  
- Accessing and modifying elements  
- Slicing, iterating, and nested lists  
- Built-in methods (`append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, `remove()`, `sort()`)  
- List comprehensions  
- Real-world use cases and small tasks  

### 🔹 Tuples
- Understanding immutability  
- Creating and unpacking tuples  
- Accessing elements  
- Using tuples in loops and functions  
- Differences between tuples and lists  
- Use cases in data protection and efficiency  

### 🔹 Sets
- Creating sets and adding/removing elements  
- Mathematical operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)  
- Removing duplicates from lists using sets  
- Iteration and set methods (`add()`, `discard()`, `update()`)  
- Real-life use cases for optimizing data lookup  

### 🔹 Dictionaries
- Key–value pair concept  
- Adding, updating, and deleting elements  
- Accessing elements using keys and methods (`get()`, `items()`, `keys()`, `values()`)  
- Nested dictionaries  
- Looping through dictionaries  
- JSON-style data handling examples

⭐ Support
If you find this helpful, please give it a ⭐ star on GitHub.
It helps others discover the project and motivates me to create more repositories for learners!


Would you like me to now create the **“Practice Questions Section”** (like 5 for Lists, 5 for Dictionaries, etc.) to include right below the “🧠 Practice & Quizzes” heading?  
It’ll make the repo look super professional and student-ready.
